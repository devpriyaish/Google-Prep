Applications:
1. Used in implementing Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algo
2. Dynamically fetch nextbest/nextworse
3. Huffman Coding
4. Best First Search
5. Minimum Spanning Tree

PQ with Binary Heap
1. Binary heap construction   O(n)
2. Polling                    O(log(n))
3. Peeking                    O(1)
4. Adding                     O(log(n))
5. Native Removing            O(n)
6. Hashtable Removing         O(log(n))
7. Native Contains            O(n)
8. Contains check (hash)      O(1)
Pros of hash: linear space + constants due to use of swaps
